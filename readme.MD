had a lot of trouble with the initial setup of the project:
- Problems with requirements.txt file being unpopulated even though I had installed flask, dnspython, pymongo etc.(I ended up deleteing the fill and setting it up again)
- I concealed my login string in .bashrc so i wouldn't be pushing it to git or storing it in cloud9. previously it was displayed in my app.py file
